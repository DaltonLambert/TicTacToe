# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe Game in React

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js. The game features a game board that is rendered using an array of squares, and allows players to take turns marking the squares with 'X' or 'O' until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.

The game allows the player to play against the computer, and the computer makes its move through the use of a separate ComputerPlayer component.

The game uses state management using  React hooks, the game board is rendered using a nested map function to iterate through the rows and columns. The game can be reset at any time to start a new game.
